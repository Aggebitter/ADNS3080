This is an example code I wrote in order to test the ADNS-3080 optical flow sensor. It was inspired by this code provided by DIY Drones: <https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/tree/5ddbcc296dd6dd9ac9ed6316ac3134c736ae8a78/libraries/AP_OpticalFlow> written by Randy Mackay.

The Python program [ADNS3080ImageGrabber.py](ADNS3080ImageGrabber.py) was copied from this [page](https://github.com/diydrones/ardupilot/tree/5ddbcc296dd6dd9ac9ed6316ac3134c736ae8a78/libraries/AP_OpticalFlow/examples/ADNS3080ImageGrabber).

More information about this sensor can be found at the following page: <http://copter.ardupilot.com/wiki/common-mouse-based-optical-flow-sensor-adns3080> and in the [datasheet](adns_3080.pdf)
